1. Javascript is a lightweight programming language commonly used by web developers to add dynamic interactions to web pages, applications, servers, and even games. 
2. 
Dynamic typing: type checking is performed at runtime, means that the type of a variable is allowed to change over its lifetime.
statically typed language checks types at compile time before the code runs
Weak typed: recognizes different data types(numbers, strings, etc.) but doesnâ€™t use them too strictly, trying to convert data when it seems reasonable
Strongly typed: A strongly typed language enforces that when a variable is declared, 
it is assigned a type (explicitly or implicitly), and for the duration of the variable's lifecycle, it will continue to have that type and only that type. 

3. 
Var is very old school. Always use in global and function scope. redeclarable
Let is block scoped local variable. Can be redeclared.
Const is block scoped local variable. Cannot be redeclared.

4. An anonymous function is a function without a name
Higher-order functions: function that returns a function or takes other functions as arguments is called
Callback functions: passed as an argument to another function to be called later
First-class functions: if functions in that language are treated like other variables

5. An object is non primitive data type and is a collection of properties, 
The property is an association between a name (or key) and a value.
